# AWS CLI

### What is Secret Access Key?
- It is a key-value pair which is generated during the time of user creation.
- It will be visible only once, so if we lose it then no option to retrieve it back.
- We can delet the onld access key and generate new one from console, but the condition is all AWS cli which are using old access key wont be access after that key is deleted.
- Once new key is generated then we can configure it with `aws configure`


### What is CLI Pagination?
- You can control the number of items included in the outur when you run a CLI command.

### Exam Tips
- If you see erros like "timed out", or errors related to too may results being retruned:
	- Adjust the pagination in of CLI results to avoid errors generated by too many results.
	- `aws s3api list-objects --bucket my-bucket --page-size 100`
- The CLI still retrieves the full list, but performs a larger number of API calls in the background and retrieves a smaller number of items with each call.
